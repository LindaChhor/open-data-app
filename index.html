            <h2>Sandra Park</h2>
            <p>A full-time mother of 3 who is tired of cleaning up after my kids that seems to have never ending amount of energy, I decided to bring them to a splash pad one day. This is a great way to tire them out, they have fun and the best part is I don't need to clean up after them in the end. After bringing them to serveral different splash pads over time, I decided to help other parents locate and rate different splash pads around the city.
